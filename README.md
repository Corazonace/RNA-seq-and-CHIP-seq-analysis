# RNA-seq-and-CHIP-seq-analysis
RNA-seq and CHIP-seq are two popular high-throughput sequencing technologies used to study gene expression and genomic regulatory elements, respectively. Integrating the results of these two technologies can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular processes. Here is a general outline of a possible RNA-seq and CHIP-seq integrative analysis pipeline:
1. Quality control
Quality control: 
The very first step is to check the quality of raw sequencing data. It can be done with FASTQC software or using the FASTQC module on Rivanna in a Linux environment. The input should be a fastq file. FASTQC will output an HTML file that shows different aspects of the quality of the raw sequencing data, such as per base sequence quality, per base sequence content, and so on. 
###quality control with FASTQC###
module load fastqc
fastqc -o [output_directory] [input_raw_data.fastq.gz]

Data trimming: 
If the data fails in many modules, itâ€™s better to trim the reads to remove adapter sequences and low-quality regions. Trimmomatic is a good tool for doing this. The following example demonstrates a trimmomatic command for paired-end data. 

###trimming###
module load trimmomatic/0.39
